### Technical Background

I have some experience with programming in Java, C, and Python. With Java, I programmed a chess game that implements a GUI, and I also used object oriented programming concepts to write code for the game as well. In C, I programmed Conway's Game of Life by using a struct, pointers, and memory allocation. I took a coding and programming in Python class in highschool and wrote code for several simple projects.

I also have some experience with using GitHub and Unix on the macOS terminal.
